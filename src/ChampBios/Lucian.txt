Once a Sentinel of Light, Lucian is a grim hunter of undying spirits, pursuing them relentlessly and annihilating them with his twin relic pistols. Consumed by the need to avenge his dead wife, he will not rest until Thresh, the specter who holds her soul, is destroyed. Merciless and single-minded, Lucian allows nothing to stand in the path of this vengeance—anyone or anything foolish enough to try is blown away by an overwhelming barrage of magical gunfire.
